# emufest
Available materials for EMUFest 2016, lecture on October 26th, Rome.
This repository provides a 'myexternal' folder where you can find the simplest external you can do in Pd.

Before EMUFest 2016, you *must* compile it. You need:

1) a text editor (Emacs, Textedit, vim, gedit, notepad, ...: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors )

2) a compiler (GCC, clang, ...: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C_compilers )

or an IDE (Xcode, Code::Blocks, ...: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#C.2FC.2B.2B )

Actually, the best solution is to install make and use the provided makefile template. Make here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software) .

If you have questions, open an issue or send me an email and I will do it for you: mm dot markidis at gmail dot com .
